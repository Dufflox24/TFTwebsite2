                <p>Teamfight Tactics is a strategic free-for-all game of attrition featuring iconic champions from League of Legends. Your goal? Grow your team and protect your board to become the last player standing.</p>

                    <h2>Game Info</h2>
                    <p>Teamfight Tactics is an autobattler: a round-based PvP game where you’ll draft a team that battles automatically on your behalf. If you've never played an autobattler before, don't worry! TFT borrows from many of the concepts you know and love about other strategy games, like drafting from a shared pool of resources, team building, economy management, and positioning.</p>

                    <h2>Game Info</h2>
                    <p>Individuals face off in 1-on-1 matches until only one player remains. You win by drafting the best team of champions from a shared pool, equipping them with powerful items, managing your gold income to buy out the competition, and positioning your team in winning battle formations. There are unlimited winning strategies, so you’ll have to adapt to different situations in every game to come out on top.</p>

                    <h2>Game Info</h2>
                    <p>Every game of TFT takes place in the Convergence, and centers around a specific theme and story called a set. Every few months TFT introduces you to a new universe with new champions, traits, and characters to play. In terms of gameplay, new sets also come with a new Ranked ladder to climb, new team compositions, and new item possibilities.</p>
